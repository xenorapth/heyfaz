					I'm driven by curiosity. The constant need to find out the 'how' and 'why' of everything that intrigues me. With a growth mindset, I see the world through a lens of opportunities and possibilities. 
					I'm known to thrive in an environment where I'm given the freedom to exercise my imagination and creativity to experiment and tackle any challenges thrown at me. Do reach out and say hi. I might just end up being your best friend. Who knows? :)
